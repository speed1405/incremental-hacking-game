  - **Bargaining**: Reduce hardware costs

### 4. **Achievements System**
- Track player milestones and reward completion
- Examples:
  - "First Hack" - Complete your first mission
  - "Power User" - Reach 1,000 power/sec
  - "Elite Hacker" - Reach Level 50
  - "Billionaire" - Accumulate 1,000,000 credits
